# Note-Taker

## Description

The Note Taker application allows users to write notes and save them so they can re-visit them later. The app uses Express.js to utilize API routes and write files to a JSON file. I would like to add a delete route for the notes in the future.

## Instructions

Users will need to download the code and run node/express.js for the application to work in the browser OR download the code and deploy to Heroku. Since the notes are written using file system to write to the JSON file, notes will still be accessible after the server is off and restarted.

## Usage

Click the get started button on the home page to be taken to the notes page.
Enter Title and note text; as you are typing a save icon will appear next to the plus in the upper right corner.
Click the save icon to save the note to the list of notes.
Click the plus to write a new note.
Click on any of the notes in the saved list to expand and read the note.
Delete button has not yet been enabled.
