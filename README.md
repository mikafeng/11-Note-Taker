# Note-Taker

# Description

The Note-Taker application allows users to write notes and save them so they can re-visit them later. The app uses Express.js to utilize API routes and write files to a database.json. I would like to add a delete route for the notes in the future.

# Instructions

Users will need to download the code and run node/express.js for the application to work in the browser. Since the notes are written using file system to write to the json file, notes will still be accessible after the server is off and restarted.
